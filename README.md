Some little piece of code to extend Polarion.

I added a new script, to approve a merge request in Gitlab from Polarion.
So now we can perform the whole process from Polarion: create a branch, create a merge request, approve the merge, and use Gitlab just as a source code repository and nothing else :)

I am storing those scripts and some other piece of code related to Polarion on this GitHub repo
